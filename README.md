# Heart_failure_prediction
Capstone - 2


Problem Statement: How can healthcare providers predict heart failure with high accuracy among individuals when their medical records are available?

Context: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) led to nearly 17.9 million deaths in 2019, which account for 32% of all global deaths. Nearly 85% of them were because of heart attack and stroke. Several health issues may serve as precursors to CVDs and heart failure/stroke. A model that can predict heart failure in patients can lead to early management of the problem and help in reducing the mortality rate.
